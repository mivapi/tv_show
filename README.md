# Main architecture decisions you've made and a quick explanation of why.
Component-based architecture because we have folders / files, components and how they are related.

# List of third party libraries and why you chose each one
FontAwesome: Icons in spite of svg extensions, I like using to make easier challenge.

# What in your code could be improved if you had more time.
I would had liked having more control with a database to save favorites and customizing suggestions as a filter (as genre, language, etc.).
Add libraries styling like bootstrap or material-UI.
Autocomplete input to display the match search list (material-UI handles lab content to help us improving without spendig time making components) .

# Mention anything that was asked but not delivered and why, and any additional comments.
If I can use frameworks to complement design, would be better.
Is this a minimal version of imdb, I did not ask for it because I though was a part of the challenge.
localstorage was a good challenge, unexpected but so great, I learn a lot.
In addition, I made css in responsive mode without frameworks.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
